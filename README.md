After cloning please switch to the master branch.
To do this, after cloning go to the directory of the cloned repository using 'cd accenture-assessment-api'
Then use 'git checkout master' to switch to the master branch

You can now open the code in VS Code.
Once opened, run 'npm install to install dependencies'
Thereafter navigate to the src directory using 'cd src'
Then run the server using 'npx ts-node-dev server.ts'

The API is now running and you can now run the frontend

ALSO, please make sure you are running the latest node.js version (or atleast a version above 16)
